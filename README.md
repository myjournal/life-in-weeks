# Life in Weeks

I originally saw this on [GitHub](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks) and thought it would be an interesting thing to try to do.

It is an interactive map of my life in weeks, where each week I've been alive is a box. The border color of each box represents where I was living, and the inner color of the box is what I was doing that week.

This code was copied from [GitHub](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks). It is a single webpage statically-rendered with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It consists of two [data](data/events.yml) [files](data/colors.yml), [an introduction](content/index.md), and a [template](layouts/_default/index.html).
